<p>
The film is about two British soldiers that are tasked with delivering a message to another battalion, warning them of walking into a trap where more than a thousand soldiers could die.
What immediately stands out about the film is that it's made in one continual shot, right until the end.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore it does a great job at retaining suspense as it is shown the protagonists are no heroes: They are simply normal people that are tasked with a mission of immense importance.
</p>

<p>
This makes the story very relatable and believable
